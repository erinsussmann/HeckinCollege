                        Exam.
                      </h2>
                      <h3>The quick cheat will take you maybe 5 minutes but is as it says: a quick fix.
                        The comprehensive exam will take you closer to 1-2 hours depending on your car, but
                        is necessary at least once a year to keep your car from breaking from oil clogs.
                      </h3>
                      <h3>
                        Before we get into how to change your oil, let's talk about why you have to. Fresh motor
                        oil, when you put it into the car, should be a golden color and have a pretty smooth flow.
                        As it circulates through the engine of the car, it picks up dust and dirt, turning it black.
                        Since you don't want these contaminants getting into the engine, you need the change the oil
                        out from time to time. Another reason to change your oil is because it quite literally burns away.
                        The temperatures in the engine (where it operates) are incredibly high, and while oil can handle
                        most temperatures, it also has a limit. So as time goes on, the oil burns away, leaving less and less
                        oil to circulate the engine, which can cause problems including the engine seizing and mechanisms
                        refusing to operate.
                      </h3>
                      <h2>
                        But how am I supposed to know WHEN to change my oil??
                      </h2>
                      <h3>
                        That brings us to our first topic: checking your oil level. As a rule, you should usually check
                        your oil once a month, and depending on the level, you'll know if you need to change your oil or
                        not.
                      </h3>
                      <h1>Checking Your Oil</h1>
                      <h2>STEP ONE: Open the Hood</h2>
                      <h3>To check your oil, you going to need to open the hood. This step you're going to have to figure out yourself, as each car is different
                        in terms of how the hood opens, what lever to pull to release it, if it has an extra lock on the
                        hood, etc. But the very first step is to open your hood.
