                        There's two ways to change your oil: the Quick Cheat and the Full-Scale Comprehensive
                        Exam.
                      </h2>
                      <h3>The quick cheat will take you maybe 5 minutes but is as it says: a quick fix.
                        The comprehensive exam will take you closer to 1-2 hours depending on your car, but
                        is necessary at least once a year to keep your car from breaking from oil clogs.
                      </h3>
                      <h3>
                        Before we get into how to change your oil, let's talk about why you have to. Fresh motor
                        oil, when you put it into the car, should be a golden color and have a pretty smooth flow.
                        As it circulates through the engine of the car, it picks up dust and dirt, turning it black.
                        Since you don't want these contaminants getting into the engine, you need the change the oil
                        out from time to time. Another reason to change your oil is because it quite literally burns away.
                        The temperatures in the engine (where it operates) are incredibly high, and while oil can handle
                        most temperatures, it also has a limit. So as time goes on, the oil burns away, leaving less and less
                        oil to circulate the engine, which can cause problems including the engine seizing and mechanisms
                        refusing to operate.
                      </h3>
                      <h2>
                        <i>But how am I supposed to know WHEN to change my oil??</i>
                      </h2>
                      <h3>
                        That brings us to our first topic: checking your oil level. As a rule, you should usually check
                        your oil once a month, and depending on the level, you'll know if you need to change your oil or
                        not. Also, make sure your car is as cold as possible (cold meaning here undriven). To ensure this,
                        the best time to check your oil is in the morning, before you drive it for the day. If you can't
                        change it in the morning (earliness, laziness, etc.), if you wait about 1 hour, the oil should
                        reach about the temperature of an undriven car.

                        in terms of how the hood opens, what lever to pull to release it, if it has an extra lock on the
                        hood, etc. But the very first step is to open your hood.

                      <h2 class="steps">STEP TWO: Locate the Dipstick</h2>
                      <h3>The dipstick is a long strip of metal that is inserted into the oil resevoir, and is used to check the oil level. It usually has an orange
                        or yellow top, and is about as long as your arm.</h3>

                      <h2 class="steps">STEP THREE: Remove the Dipstick</h2>
                      <h3>To remove the dipstick, pull straight up until the full dipstick is removed. To get an accurate reading, we'll remove the dipstick
                        once, put it back in, then remove it again. In order to gain stability and reduce the random flinging of oil, take the paper towel
                        and wrap it around the dipstick after it's been pulled up about 3 inches. We're doing this to clean the stick and provide ourselves
                        stability when removing it. The first time we remove the stick, keep the paper towel on the entire time you remove it, cleaning it from
                        top to bottom. After you've cleaned the whole stick, put it back in the car, then remove it again. This time, instead of cleaning the whole
                        stick, stop the paper towel about 3 inches above the bottom.
                      </h3>
                      <h2 class="steps">STEP FOUR: Read the Dipstick</h2>
                      <h3>At the bottom of your dipstick, there will be some sort of measurement, either with three levels or two levels.</h3>

                      <h3>The top line will indicate that the oil is full. If the oil is a yellow color and is between the full line and half-way down, your oil
                        should be fine, and you wouldn't really need to change your oil. If the oil is less than half-way down, no matter the color, you will need
                        to change your oil. Make sure your oil doesn't go below the bottom line, which indicates the oil is low and needs to be changed immediatly
                        if you want to avoid engine damage.
                      </h3>

                        If you don't want to use any of these websites, I would go bback to your dealer or mechanic and ask what type of oil you should use.

                      <h3>Like I said, this is a quick fix, so all we're essentially doing is topping off the oil. As you're not starting with 0 oil, you'll have to be a little
                        more careful with pouring the right amount of oil. It's better to do this slowly, pouring a little at a time, then checking the oil level to see how much more
                        you need. But once you hit the Max/Full line on the dipstick, you're done!
                      </h3>
                      <h1><b><ins>The Comprehensive Exam</ins></b></h1>
                      <h3>This way is longer and harder, but definitely needs to be done at least once a year. It's recommended to be done every 3000 miles, but if you're reading
                        this, you probably don't know what your mileage is, or at least when your oil was changed last, so let's stick with once a year.</h3>
