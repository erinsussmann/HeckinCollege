                    <div id="cuttingBoards">
                      <h2>Cut!Cut!Cut!</h2>
                      <h3> Plastic vs Wood cutting boards</h3>
                      <p>First, to anyone who is in doubt, yes you need a cutting board. Do NOT cut on your
                      countertop. The kind of cutting board you use affects the sanitation process of your board. It could also
                      affect the lifetime of your knife.</p>

                      <h4>Plastic Cutting Boards</h4>
                        <p>Plastic cutting boards are cheaper than wooden cutting boards. They are easier to clean than
                        their wooden counterpart. Thus, many would argue that they are cleaner than the other kinds of cutting board.
                        However, some people fail to realize that plastic cutting boards tend to be ridden with gashes from knife cuts.
                        Bacteria can grow within these gashes, thereby contamonating the board itself.</p>

                      <h4> Wooden Cutting Boards</h4>
                        <p>Wooden cutting boards tend to be more expensive but lasts longer than plastic cutting boards. Depending on
                        the kind of wood that the board is made off, the lifetime of your knife and board can vary. Cutting boards made
                        out of hardwoods like walnut and maple will dull your knife faster but will be more resistant to scratches and cuts.
                        On the other hand, boards made out of softer woods wold dull your knife less but could sustain cuts faster. Just like
                        in the plastic boards, bacteria grows within the cuts in the wood. </p>

                      <h3>Cleaning your boards</h3>
                        <p>Because plastic and wood boards have different characteristics, their care instrcution would also be different.
                        Plastic boards can be put in the dishwasher and cleaned with high temperature water. On the other hand, wood
                        cutting boards will be ruined by the dishwasher
                       </p>

                       <p>If cleaning boards by hand, whether it is plastic or wood, you should do the following:
                           <ul>
                             <li> Rinse the board of debris </li>
                             <li> Scrubb the board with soap and water
                             <li> Rinse the board thoroughly</li>
                             <li> Sanitize with the appropriate sanitizer
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Wood cutting boards should be sanitized using an quaternary ammonium sanitizer.</li>
                                    <li> Plastic boards should be sanitized using a chlorine-based soluton.</li>
                                  </ul>
                             </li>
                           </ul>
